* shuffling board has to get smart either quit after a certain number of iterations or just plain better. atm a process can hang while trying to shuffle forever

* options_create() with a var_arg at the end for colors
then options_destroy()

* options_are_valid()

* print_options()

* board_is_identical()
... would it care to compare options too ? should be just board compare not options i think
